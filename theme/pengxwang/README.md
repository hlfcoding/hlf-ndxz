> :framed_picture: A complete example theme for Silexhibit.

## Design

This theme, like its sole dependency `hlf-dom-extensions`, is designed around modern browsers, which have begun to support new CSS and JS features previously only in SASS and CS, respectively. This reduces the tooling and dependencies required. As a result, the majority of code is CSS.

## Features

- Support for phones and tablets
- Support for `slideshow` exhibit
- Support for preview text in index items
- Support for custom content sections like link-lists
- Index-exhibit flexible two-column layout using flex-box
